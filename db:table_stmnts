CREATE DATABASE RANGERMOTORSAUSTIN;


CREATE TABLE cars(
	VIN varchar(30),
	Year varchar(30),
	Model varchar(30),
	Body_Style varchar(30),
	Mileage varchar(30),
	Transmission varchar(30),
	Engine varchar(30),
	Drivetrain varchar(30),
	Exterior varchar(30),
	Interior varchar(30),
	Doors varchar(30),
	Stock varchar(30),
	Fuel_Mileage varchar(30),
	Condition varchar(30),);

This table could use some better value types
namely :
	year
	Mileage
	Maybe engine
	Probably engine
	Doors
	Maybe Fuel_Mileage
	Probably
but as long as you change the value types to the correct ones in the database,
you need to also change the value types that were scraped as strings to the correct types in the pipeline.
